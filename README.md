# 👋 Hi, I'm Atsushi Oka (岡 敦)

Hi, I am not an English speaker and this is my AI generated profile; though it is not written by me, they are mostly aligned to my real philosophy,too. I am just not very good at writing English. << This was written by me, though.

## 🎸 Music Meets Code

I'm a jazz guitarist, rhythm analyst, and full-stack engineer.  
My life bridges sound and syntax—swing and structure.  
While most people separate art from logic, I believe **groove and grammar share a pulse**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🎵 **Jazz Guitar & Rhythm Theory**  
  Exploring *groove beyond notation*, and developing methods to quantify musical "soul."  
  Special focus on the contrast between **縦乗り (tatenori)** and syncopated rhythm.

- 🌐 **Full-stack Engineering**  
  Architect of self-made Node.js + PostgreSQL frameworks.  
  Passionate about minimal, expressive systems.  

- 💬 **Linguistic Hacking**  
  Fluent in **Japanese**, **Lao Isaan**, **Thai**, and **English**  
  I also "speak" **Java**, **Lisp**, **Scheme**, and several custom DSLs I've crafted.

## 🔬 Current Projects

- 🎶 **Tatenori Analysis Toolkit** – Quantifying rhythm feel using multi-layered time divisions (12/8, 36/16, 108/16)  
- 📚 **Thankspedia/libtbc** – A grassroots semantic network with versioned systemd-like modularity  
- ✍️ **English Translations** of my 70+ articles on Japanese rhythm culture  
- 🧵 **Inner Dojo Blog** – Philosophical writing on language, jazz, AI, and cultural perception

## 🛠️ Stack Highlights — Built From First Principles

| Layer         | Technologies Used           | My Contribution                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | React / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS | Built modular UI components and design systems with handcrafted logic for data-driven views. |
| **Backend**   | Node.js / Express / Custom DSLs | Designed entire server-side frameworks, including routing, auth, async task pipelines, and custom domain-specific languages (DSLs). |
| **Data / Infra** | PostgreSQL / systemd / UTM (ARM VM on macOS) | Architected full database schemas, multi-server systemd service orchestration, and portable dev environments via virtualized ARM setups. |

> I don’t just *use* frameworks — I **create them from scratch**,  
> down to their routing, serialization, configuration, and deployment layers.

### 🧱 My Philosophy

I believe in building tools that do *exactly* what’s needed—nothing more, nothing less.  
This means **understanding the internals**, stripping away abstractions when needed,  
and writing **expressive, minimal, deeply composable systems**.

Whether it's a music sequencer in Scheme, a multi-versioned knowledge base, or a service orchestration layer using `systemd`,   I take pride in writing code that feels like it was meant to be played, not just compiled.
