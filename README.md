# Atsushi Oka (Ats) — Full-Stack Engineer | Developer Tooling | TypeScript/Node/PostgreSQL

I build systems that last: web application frameworks, automation tooling, and documentation/publishing pipelines.
I care about explicit design, readable code, and architectures that remain maintainable after years.

English is my second language; some wording may be AI-assisted.

## What I do
- Build full-stack web applications (API + DB + UI) with TypeScript/Node.js/PostgreSQL
- Design internal platforms (routing, auth, job pipelines, config/deploy, tooling)
- Ship practical frontend features in React, including performance-oriented UI patterns (e.g., infinite scrolling)

## Proof (projects)
- **Rhythmpress** — Quarto-based publishing/CMS toolkit used to generate structured documentation sites  
  https://github.com/ats4u/rhythmpress

- **Thankspedia.js** — Full-stack framework for database-driven apps (Node.js + PostgreSQL), focused on minimal and composable architecture  
  https://github.com/thankspedia

- **Lambda Music** — Scheme-based programmable music composition system (language-driven workflows)  
  https://github.com/lambda-music/lambda-music

## Technical strengths
- **Backend / Data**: Node.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Linux/systemd
- **Frontend**: React (incl. infinite scrolling), TypeScript
- **Tooling / Writing**: GitHub Actions, Quarto + Obsidian workflow, automation scripts
- **Languages**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Scheme (Guile/Kawa), Perl, Delphi (Object Pascal)
- **Legacy / Migration**: experience porting host/legacy systems to Unix server environments
- **Dev environment**: Neovim, tmux; daily Linux user (Ubuntu since 9.04)

## AI-augmented development (how I use AI)
- Use AI as a pair programmer with **explicit constraints** and **review-first** workflow
- Prefer interactive, inspectable workflows (often via web UI) over blind code generation
- Verify outputs with tests, small patches, and security-conscious checks (no copy/paste execution of untrusted code)

I’m open to roles or consulting work in backend/full-stack engineering, developer tooling, and platform-style projects.
